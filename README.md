# 100 days of python code
This repo contains my each day simple small python project as I advanced from a python beginner ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ.

As I am going through a 100 days of python bootcamp course from Udemy, each I am assigned with a project, which I will try to complete and
store these here. Good luck to myself!

One thing to note that, I have skipped uploading day-41 to day-45 code file, since in those days, I have gone
through some basic HTML and CSS knowledge instead of learning python before jumping to webscrapping.
