Taking in bathhouses, spirits of Shinto folklore, and morality without clear-cut distinctions of good and evil, Hayao Miyazaki's major crossover hit is distinctly Japanese. Its narrative arc and characters feel notably different to more conventional British and American animations \u2013 from the eerie, inscrutable No-Face, to sort-of-antagonist bathhouse owner Yubaba. But that's also a major reason why it connected \u2013 Spirited Away is accessible, but nothing about it feels watered down. It is, of course, utterly beautiful too \u2013 boundlessly imaginative, steeped in gorgeous colour, and stunningly scored by Joe Hisaishi. Among the cultural specificity is a coming-of-age universality in young hero Chihiro, forced to fend for herself when her parents are turned into pigs, using her resourcefulness and her friendship with boy-dragon-spirit Haku to earn her freedom from the spirit world. It's the film that brought Studio Ghibli \u2013 and anime at large \u2013 to mainstream Western audiences, an influence increasingly felt in the likes of [Moana](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/moana-review/) and [Frozen II](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/frozen-ii/).<br>[Read the Empire review.](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/spirited-away-review/)<br>[Buy now on Amazon.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00M482XCY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=emparticle142-21&linkId=21d796958369a86a91e9953a4f6aaaf4&language=en_GB)<br>",

Taking in bathhouses, spirits of Shinto folklore, and morality without clear-cut distinctions of good and evil, Hayao Miyazaki's major crossover hit is distinctly Japanese. Its narrative arc and characters feel notably different to more conventional British and American animations \u2013 from the eerie, inscrutable No-Face, to sort-of-antagonist bathhouse owner Yubaba. But that's also a major reason why it connected \u2013 Spirited Away is accessible, but nothing about it feels watered down. It is, of course, utterly beautiful too \u2013 boundlessly imaginative, steeped in gorgeous colour, and stunningly scored by Joe Hisaishi. Among the cultural specificity is a coming-of-age universality in young hero Chihiro, forced to fend for herself when her parents are turned into pigs, using her resourcefulness and her friendship with boy-dragon-spirit Haku to earn her freedom from the spirit world. It's the film that brought Studio Ghibli \u2013 and anime at large \u2013 to mainstream Western audiences, an influence increasingly felt in the likes of [Moana](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/moana-review/) and [Frozen II](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/frozen-ii/).<br>[Read the Empire review.](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/spirited-away-review/)<br>[Buy now on Amazon.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00M482XCY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=emparticle142-21&linkId=21d796958369a86a91e9953a4f6aaaf4&language=en_GB)<br>",
